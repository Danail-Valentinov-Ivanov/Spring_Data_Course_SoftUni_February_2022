# Spring_Data_Course_SoftUni_February_2022
This repository contains homework exercises with problems description.

## Course Description
In the [Spring Data](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3592/spring-data-february-2022) course it will be focused on the details of working with modern ORM technology: **Hibernate**, which is practically a standard for ORM in Java applications. Hibernate allows mapping between the relational database and the object-oriented model (Java classes) through so called  **"database first"** and **"code first"** approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and CRUD operations from Java. In addition Spring Data upgrades further the standard API and provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process database data. In the run of the course it will be demonstrated established practices in building a database layer of complex systems in Java applications through built-in implementations of the Repository template and the use of a service layer (Service Layer), as well as import and export to various data formats (JSON, XML).
